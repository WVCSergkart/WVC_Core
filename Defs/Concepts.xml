	<description>Mod "WVC - Core" adds several walls, doors and floors in different styles. All of them have a huge advantage over vanilla ones and require quite expensive resources in not small quantities.\n\nLogically, they should make the settlement very expensive and attract a huge number of raiders. However, it is not. These buildings have less impact on the price of a settlement than wooden walls.\n\nWhy is that? This is because I capped the cost of these buildings to 1 silver, so you can safely build a huge mechanoid-styled complex without fear that it will turn the game into a war against 5 fps.</description>

	<description>By default, mechanites are used only as crafting material, food, and for the construction of some buildings. In the setting in the "General" tab this can be changed.\n\nHowever, the important point is that this can be very unbalanced, so use this feature only if you are sure that there is nowhere to break the balance.\n\nFor example, with the help of mechanites, you can refuel the "Gene-tailoring Pod" from the "VFE - Ancients" mod and gain access to the essentially endless use of this device. From myself I will say that the balance of this thing is so terrible that the abilities that can be obtained from it are often useless or harmful if not rerolled.</description>
