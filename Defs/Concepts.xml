	<label>WVC - About buildings</label>
	<!-- In-game -->
	<description>Mod "WVC - Core" adds several walls, doors and floors in different styles. All of them have a huge advantage over vanilla ones and require quite expensive resources in not small quantities.\n\nLogically, they should make the settlement very expensive and attract a huge number of raiders. However, it is not. These buildings have less impact on the price of a settlement than wooden walls.\n\nWhy is that? This is because I capped the cost of these buildings to 1 silver, so you can safely build a huge mechanoid-styled complex without fear that it will turn the game into a war against 5 fps.</description>

	<description>By default, mechanites are used only as crafting material, food, and for the construction of some buildings. In the setting in the "Resources" tab this can be changed.\n\nHowever, the important point is that this can be very unbalanced, so use this feature only if you are sure that there is nowhere to break the balance.\n\nFor example, with the help of mechanites, you can refuel the "Gene-tailoring Pod" from the "VFE - Ancients" mod and gain access to the essentially endless use of this device. From myself I will say that the balance of this thing is so terrible that the abilities that can be obtained from it are often useless or harmful if not rerolled.</description>

	<description>For a basic introduction to the rimworld, the Valkyries are not well suited because they are less fastidious, less likely to get sick, less likely to break down, more tenacious and generally smart and beautiful. However, this does not make them invulnerable.\n\nIf you lose a pawn, this is sad and insulting, but you can quickly find a replacement in its place, in the event of the death of the Valkyrie, this is a tragedy for the colony. These girls are the best fighters and their adult representatives can stand alone against hundreds of enemies (Tested on a large insect hive). But in order to become truly invincible, the Valkyrie must live to be 20 years old, and the average age at which they spawn is 13-15. And the younger they are, the less tenacious they are.\n\nThe Valkyries have a number of flaws that I, the mod developer, are still working on. The first and most notable is the dress restrictions, Valks cannot wear normal clothes and it is not possible to equip them with armor, however fortunately they can wear hats, but they will not be visible.</description>
